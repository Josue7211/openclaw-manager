# OpenClaw Manager — CLAUDE.md

## What is this?
A Tauri v2 desktop app — personal command center combining iMessage (via BlueBubbles), AI chat, task management, homelab monitoring, and agent orchestration. Think Discord meets iOS Settings.

**Open source.** This app will be published publicly for anyone to replicate the setup. All integrations are modular — users enable only what they have (Messages requires a Mac with BlueBubbles, HomeLab requires Proxmox, etc.). The setup guide, architecture docs, and configuration should be clear enough for someone to go from zero to a working installation.

## Privacy & Security — CRITICAL

This is open source software that handles private data. **Zero private data may be committed or exposed:**

- **NEVER** commit `.env.local`, API keys, passwords, tokens, IPs, or Tailscale addresses
- **NEVER** hardcode any credential, URL, or personal identifier in source code
- **ALL** secrets go through the OS keychain (via `src-tauri/src/secrets.rs`) — never in env files, localStorage, or source
- **ALL** service URLs (BlueBubbles, OpenClaw, Supabase) come from user configuration (Settings → Connections or `.env.local`) — never hardcoded
- **Redact** credentials from all log output — use `redact_bb_url()` and never log raw URLs with passwords
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home** — the app is fully self-hosted and offline-capable
- `.gitignore` must exclude: `.env*`, `*.log`, `target/`, `node_modules/`, SQLite databases, keychain exports, `.playwright-mcp/`
- Screenshots in docs must have personal data (messages, contacts, IPs) redacted
- The `MC_API_KEY` is auto-generated per install and stored in the OS keychain — it is never shared or transmitted

- **NEVER upload files to the internet** — no pastebin, no 0x0.st, no file sharing services. EVER. This has happened before (env file uploaded to 0x0) and must NEVER happen again
- **NEVER use `curl` to upload**, `wget --post`, or any tool that sends local files to external servers
- **NEVER share file contents** via any online service — all debugging and sharing happens locally or via git

- **NEVER run `git checkout` on uncommitted work** — this destroys changes that cannot be recovered. If a file needs to be reverted, copy it first or ask the user. This has happened before and wiped hours of work on Sidebar.tsx and GlobalSearch.tsx.
- **NEVER run destructive git commands** (`git checkout --`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`) without explicit user confirmation and a backup plan

When in doubt: **if it's personal data, it doesn't go in the repo. If it's a file, it doesn't get uploaded anywhere.**

## Quality Gates — CRITICAL, NON-NEGOTIABLE

**NOTHING is "complete" until it is TESTED and VERIFIED in a running application.** A commit existing is not verification. A SUMMARY.md existing is not verification. Code compiling is necessary but NOT sufficient. This is the #1 rule of this project.

### Per-Phase Gates (ALL MUST PASS before advancing)

1. **Compilation** — `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/mc-target cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` + `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.app.json` — ZERO errors. If either fails, STOP.
2. **Full Test Suite** — `cd frontend && npx vitest run` + `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/mc-target cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — ALL pass. If any fail, STOP.
3. **Dead Code** — `cargo clippy` — no NEW warnings from this phase. Pre-existing allowed.
4. **Live Browser Testing** — agent-browser (or Playwright fallback) navigates to every affected page and:
   - Actually USES every feature (clicks buttons, submits forms, verifies data flows)
   - Tests error states and empty states
   - Checks browser console for 500s, 404s, JS errors
   - Verifies layouts render correctly, no broken CSS
5. **Connection Verification** — API calls return real data, SSE streams deliver events, WebSocket connects
6. **Visual Verification** — No misaligned elements, no broken layouts, no missing icons

### Per-Milestone Gates (before tagging)

ALL per-phase gates PLUS:
- agent-browser tests EVERY page in the app (not just touched pages)
- Playwright E2E: `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e`
- `npx knip` — no new dead code
- Full regression smoke test across all features

### Rules

- **Autonomous mode = make decisions yourself. It does NOT mean skip quality gates.**
- A phase with failing tests is NOT complete
- A phase with console errors is NOT complete
- A phase that hasn't been live-tested is NOT complete
- NEVER advance to the next phase on a broken codebase
- Quality is more important than speed. ALWAYS.

## Infrastructure — CRITICAL CONTEXT

The system runs across multiple machines. The Tauri app must work on ANY machine.

```

**Key implications:**
- Mission log files (`/tmp/*.log`) exist on the Services VM, NOT on the user's machine
- Mission events are ingested INTO Supabase FROM the Services VM
- The Tauri app reads mission events FROM Supabase — it never reads log files directly
- BlueBubbles runs on a Mac — Messages only work when that Mac is reachable via Tailscale
- Supabase is self-hosted on a separate services VM
- The app connects to all services via Tailscale IPs, configured in `.env.local`
- ALL data flows through APIs — no local file access for remote data
- Plex VM runs the Cloudflare Tunnel — it's the gateway for all `*.aparcedo.org` subdomains

**Infrastructure security posture:**
- All VMs: UFW firewall active, SSH key-only (passphrase-protected), fail2ban, kernel hardening (sysctl), unattended-upgrades
- Services-VM: Docker log rotation (`daemon.json`), container resource limits, PostgreSQL/Portainer/Vaultwarden/CouchDB bound to 127.0.0.1
- Plex-VM: Cloudflare Tunnel gateway, Plex port 32400 open for remote streaming, WireGuard keys in `.env` (chmod 600)
- OpenClaw-VM: Sunshine host for Moonlight remote desktop streaming
- SSH key `~/.ssh/mission-control` has a passphrase — non-interactive SSH from Bash tool will fail. Give commands to user instead.

## Tech Stack

```
Frontend: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + TanStack React Query
Backend:  Rust (Tauri v2 + embedded Axum server on localhost:3000)
Database: Supabase (self-hosted PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth)
Notes:    CouchDB (Obsidian LiveSync format, proxied through Axum)
Messages: BlueBubbles API (macOS iMessage bridge, remote via Tailscale)
AI Chat:  OpenClaw gateway (WebSocket + HTTP, remote VM)
Mac:      Mac Bridge (Reminders, Notes, Contacts, Find My — macOS only)
Network:  Tailscale mesh VPN connecting all VMs
Edge:     Cloudflare Access on *.aparcedo.org (GitHub/Google OAuth)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd frontend && npm install          # Install frontend deps
cargo tauri dev                     # Run full app (Tauri + Vite)
cd frontend && npm run dev          # Frontend only (browser mode at localhost:5173)
```

## Testing

```bash
cd frontend && npx vitest run       # 1039 frontend tests (53 test files)
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e     # 21 E2E tests (Playwright via scripts/e2e.sh)
cd src-tauri && cargo test          # 231 Rust tests
./scripts/pre-commit.sh             # Run everything
```

## Supabase CLI

CLI is configured. Run all `db:*` scripts from the **project root** (not `frontend/`).

```bash
npm run db:tunnel   # Open SSH tunnels — run once per session before any db:* command
npm run db:push     # Apply pending migrations to remote DB
npm run db:pull     # Pull remote schema as a new migration file
npm run db:types    # Generate frontend/src/lib/database.types.ts via pg-meta
npm run db:diff     # Show schema diff
```

**Gotchas:**
- Tunnel must be open before all other db commands (forwards `:15432`→postgres, `:15433`→pg-meta)
- `PGSSLMODE=disable` is required — the `?sslmode=disable` URL param is ignored by the CLI
- `db:types` bypasses the CLI (uses pg-meta API directly) — Docker is not installed locally
- DB user is `supabase_admin`, not `postgres` — all tables are owned by `supabase_admin`
- Migration files must use 14-digit timestamp format: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_name.sql`
- SSH key: `~/.ssh/mission-control` — aliases `services-vm` (`<SERVICES_VM_IP>`), `openclaw-vm` (`<OPENCLAW_VM_IP>`), and `plex-vm`
- `db:push` connects via supavisor pooler which may downgrade roles — if migrations fail with "must be owner", push directly: `ssh services-vm "docker exec -i supabase-db psql -U supabase_admin -d postgres" < supabase/migrations/XXXX.sql`
- After manual push, register migrations: `INSERT INTO supabase_migrations.schema_migrations (version) VALUES ('XXXX') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;`
- Duplicate migration file prefixes (e.g. two `0007_*` files) break sqlx — each must have a unique numeric prefix
- `cargo tauri dev` doesn't always recompile after editing `.rs` files — `touch` the file to force it

## Development Workflow — SUBAGENT-DRIVEN

**Always use subagent-driven development.** Launch specialized agents in parallel to maximize throughput. The main conversation stays free to coordinate, launch more agents, and respond to the user.

### How to work:
1. **Break work into independent tasks** — each task gets its own agent
2. **Launch agents in parallel** — use `run_in_background: true` for all agents
3. **Use specialized agent types:**
   - `feature-dev:code-explorer` — understand codebase before making changes
   - `feature-dev:code-architect` — design architecture for new features
   - `feature-dev:code-reviewer` — review code for bugs, security, quality
   - `code-simplifier:code-simplifier` — clean up and simplify code
   - `/frontend-design` — UI/UX design and implementation
   - `/security-review` — security audit
   - `/simplify` — code quality review + fix
4. **Never do work inline** that an agent could do — delegate everything
5. **Report results** as agents complete — don't make the user wait
6. **Fix issues immediately** by launching fix agents when review agents find problems
7. **Run all review types** after major changes: security, quality, reuse, performance, accessibility, architecture, dead code, tests, API consistency, state management, UX consistency

### Agent launch pattern:
```
User asks for X
→ Launch 3-10 agents in parallel covering different aspects of X
→ Stay available to answer questions / launch more agents
→ Report each agent's results as they complete
→ Launch fix agents for any issues found
→ Run review agents after fixes
→ Final test suite verification
```

### DO NOT:
- Do inline research when an agent could explore
- Write code directly when an agent could implement
- Review code manually when a reviewer agent exists
- Make the user wait while you read files — launch an agent instead

## Network & Authentication

All inter-service communication runs over a **Tailscale mesh VPN** — nothing is exposed to the public internet. Authentication operates at three distinct layers:

### Layer 1: Local process isolation (MC_API_KEY)

The embedded Axum server listens on `127.0.0.1:3000` — it only accepts connections from the same machine. The `MC_API_KEY` (auto-generated, stored in OS keychain) prevents other local processes from accessing the API. This is defense-in-depth: even if malware runs on the same machine, it cannot call the API without the key.

- The Tauri webview sends `X-API-Key` on every request via the fetch wrapper in `lib/api.ts`
- In debug mode, requests from `localhost` origins are allowed without the key (developer convenience)
- Health, OAuth callback, and static resource paths are exempt from auth

### Layer 2: Network-level auth (Tailscale ACLs)

Remote services (BlueBubbles, OpenClaw, Supabase) are only reachable via Tailscale IPs (`100.x.x.x`). Tailscale provides:

- **Mutual authentication**: every node has a WireGuard identity verified by the coordination server
- **ACL enforcement**: only authorized nodes can reach specific services/ports
- **Encrypted transit**: all traffic is WireGuard-encrypted end-to-end
- **No port forwarding**: services bind to Tailscale IPs only, invisible to the public internet

This means the app does not need to manage tokens or API keys for service-to-service auth beyond what each service requires (e.g. BlueBubbles password). The network layer guarantees that only tailnet members can connect.

### Layer 3: Edge authentication (Cloudflare Access)

All `*.aparcedo.org` subdomains are protected by Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust). Users must authenticate via GitHub or Google OAuth before reaching any service. The `supabase.aparcedo.org` subdomain has a Bypass rule since Kong API gateway handles its own key-auth — Cloudflare Access would break the REST/Auth/Realtime API flows.

### Tailscale peer identity verification

Implemented in `src-tauri/src/tailscale.rs`:

1. On startup, `startup_verify()` validates that configured service IPs match expected Tailscale hostnames
2. `tailscale status --json` builds a local map of node name → IP for validation
3. Settings → Connections surfaces Tailscale peer verification status with expected hostname fields
4. `verify_peer()` checks IP matches expected hostname before sending credentials

## Key Design Decisions

### Full-bleed pages
Messages and Settings use `position: absolute; inset: 0` to fill the entire main area. The `<main>` has `overflow: hidden` — each page manages its own scrolling internally. Other pages (Personal, Dashboard) scroll via the inner wrapper div with padding.

### Data fetching
Use **React Query** for all data fetching. Query keys are centralized in `lib/query-keys.ts`. Supabase realtime subscriptions should invalidate queries via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`, not call manual fetch functions.

### State management
- **Server state**: React Query (useQuery, useMutation)
- **URL state**: React Router
- **Local persistence**: `useLocalStorageState` hook from `lib/hooks/`
- **Cross-component reactive state**: `useSyncExternalStore` pattern (see `lib/keybindings.ts`, `lib/sidebar-settings.ts`)
- **DO NOT** use custom DOM events (`window.dispatchEvent`) for cross-component communication
- **DO NOT** read localStorage directly in event handlers — use the reactive store pattern

### Supabase client
Import `supabase` from `@/lib/supabase/client` — it's a singleton. Never call `createAuthClient()` in components.

### CSS & Styling
- Use CSS variables from `globals.css` — never hardcode colors, easings, or z-indices
- Key variables: `--accent`, `--hover-bg`, `--active-bg`, `--ease-spring`, `--z-sidebar`, `--z-modal`, `--apple-blue`, `--text-on-accent`, `--text-on-color`, `--warning`, `--green-400`, `--green-500`, `--red-500`, `--blue`, `--amber`, `--purple`, `--orange`, `--yellow`, `--gold`
- WCAG contrast-safe solid variants: `--accent-solid`, `--green-solid`, `--red-solid` — use these for text/icons on white backgrounds
- Use hover utility classes (`.hover-bg`, `.hover-bg-bright`) instead of inline `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave`
- Prefer `var(--ease-spring)` over hardcoded `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`
- Light theme: `[data-theme="light"]` overrides in globals.css

### Components
- Wrap frequently-rendered components in `React.memo` (avatars, list items, toggles)
- Shared components: `Lightbox`, `SecondsAgo`, `Toggle`, `PageErrorBoundary`
- Shared hooks: `useEscapeKey`, `useLocalStorageState`, `useFocusTrap`, `useApiError`, `useSupabaseRealtime`
- Generic `LRUCache` in `lib/lru-cache.ts` — used for avatar and link preview caches
- Settings page split into sub-components in `pages/settings/` (8 lazy-loaded panels + shared.ts + Toggle.tsx)
- Messages page split into sub-components in `pages/messages/` (ConversationList, MessageThread, ComposePanel, types, utils)
- Message UI sub-components live in `components/messages/`
- Message hooks live in `hooks/messages/`

### Accessibility (non-negotiable)
- All buttons must be `<button>`, never `<div onClick>`
- Icon-only buttons need `aria-label`
- Modals need `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, focus trap via `useFocusTrap`
- Toggles need `role="switch"`, `aria-checked`
- Inputs need `aria-label` or `<label>`
- Dynamic content needs `aria-live` regions

### Security
> Full security model: **[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)** — architecture, threat model, encryption, monitoring, and contributor rules.

**Quick rules for contributors:**
- Secrets flow through `AppState.secret()`, not `std::env::var()`
- Never log credentials — use `redact()` from `redact.rs`
- Use `RequireAuth` extractor on all data endpoints (MFA enforced)
- Use `validate_uuid()` / `sanitize_postgrest_value()` for all Supabase query inputs
- CSP blocks `unsafe-eval` — no `Function()` or string-based `setTimeout()`
- OAuth uses PKCE + nonce verification to prevent code injection
- Shell permissions scoped to HTTPS/HTTP URLs only
- Tokens stored server-side only (Rust `AppState.session`) — frontend never sees JWTs
- MFA hard gate: `RequireAuth` checks `mfa_verified` before all data access
- 24-hour hard session expiry regardless of token refresh
- Dev mode: session persisted to `_dev_session` SQLite table (1h expiry, `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` only)
- AES-256-GCM for user_secrets encryption, Argon2id key derivation, `zeroize` on drop
- Constant-time API key comparison via `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`
- Rate limiting per-user per-path (not shared bucket)
- SSRF protection with DNS pinning via `reqwest .resolve()`

### Axum Route Gotchas
- `cargo tauri dev` uses `--no-default-features` — `cargo build` alone produces a DIFFERENT binary. Always `cargo clean -p mission-control` before restart.
- Handlers returning `Result<Response, AppError>` may silently fail to register in merged routers. Use `Result<Json<Value>, AppError>` to match all other handlers.
- Test new routes with `curl` immediately after adding — don't assume compilation = registration.

### Sidebar Configuration
- `lib/sidebar-config.ts` — category layout, custom names, deleted items, recycled categories, panel titles (localStorage + Supabase sync)
- `lib/modules.ts` — enabled/disabled module IDs (localStorage + Supabase sync via `enabled-modules` key)
- Standalone items = categories with `name: ''` — auto-cleaned when empty, auto-split when >1 item
- Unused panel shows ALL disabled built-in modules regardless of category membership
- `SettingsModules.tsx` manages drag-and-drop between: Modules panel, Unused panel, Recycle Bin, and inter-category drop zones
- `ResizablePanel.tsx` supports `onDragOver`/`onDrop` props and `onTitleChange` for double-click editing

### Notes / Vault
- Backend proxy at `/api/vault/*` (`routes/vault.rs`) — CouchDB credentials never reach the frontend
- CouchDB stores Obsidian LiveSync format: parent docs with `children` array → `h:*` chunk docs with `data` field
- `eden` field contains inline newborn chunks not yet graduated to standalone docs
- `newnote` type = base64-encoded chunks; `plain` type = raw text
- Frontend `lib/vault.ts` uses the `api` wrapper (not raw fetch) — all CRUD through Axum proxy
- Metadata cached in localStorage (`mc-notes-meta`); full content fetched from backend on demand
- LiveSync internal docs (`h:*`, `ps:*`, `ix:*`, `cc:*`, `_design/*`) filtered on both backend and frontend
- Image attachments: chunks decoded individually to bytes, concatenated, re-encoded as single base64 (padding per-chunk breaks concat)
- Use query-param routes (`/vault/doc?id=...`) for doc IDs containing slashes (e.g. `homework/image.png`) — browsers decode `%2F` in paths
- `is_attachment()` checks file extension to skip `decode_chunk_data` for binary files (PNG bytes aren't valid UTF-8)
- LiveSync hidden files use `i:` prefix (not `!:`); filter with `.obsidian` substring match + `!:` + `!_` prefixes
- Request logger in `server.rs` skips paths ending in `.png` — add explicit `tracing::info!` for image handlers

### Mac Bridge (macOS companion service)
- REST API on MacBook exposing Apple services: Reminders, Notes, Contacts, Find My, Messages (mark-read + attachments)
- Source: `github.com/Josue7211/mac-bridge` (separate repo)
- Runs as launchd service on Mac, listens on `0.0.0.0:4100`
- API key auth (constant-time comparison), rate limiting (60/min), input length limits
- Axum proxies to it via `MAC_BRIDGE_HOST` + `MAC_BRIDGE_API_KEY` secrets
- Reminders route: `src-tauri/src/routes/reminders.rs` (uses `bridge_fetch()` pattern)

### Notifications
- 4 independent toggles: DND, system, in-app, sound
- DND overrides all others
- Per-conversation mute stored in localStorage
- SSE messages deduplicated by GUID before notifying
- Contact names resolved via `contactLookupRef`

### Performance
- Conversation list is virtualized (`@tanstack/react-virtual`)
- Message thread is NOT virtualized (variable heights cause jank)
- Lazy-loaded modals: CommandPalette, KeyboardShortcutsModal, OnboardingWelcome
- Dashboard polling consolidated to 2 intervals (fast 10s, slow 30s)
- Bounded caches: avatar (500, Arc<Vec<u8>>), link preview (500)
- `React.memo` on: ContactAvatar, GroupAvatar, NavSection, SidebarQuickCapture, Toggle

## Commit Style
- No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` lines
- Short imperative subject line
- Body explains why, not what

## Platform
- Primary: Linux (CachyOS + Hyprland) and macOS
- Also targets: Windows
- BlueBubbles (iMessage) is macOS-only — Messages page only works with a Mac running BlueBubbles
- Mac Bridge is macOS-only — Reminders, Apple Notes sync, Contacts, Find My
- System tray integration via Tauri tray-icon feature (Waybar compatible)
- Custom title bar with traffic light buttons (auto-hide supported)
